# Gamer-List

Gamer List is an Ionic/Angular smart phone application where user's can get updates on their favorite video games, search for new games, watch trailers/screenshots, rate games, and build collections of games in a wishlist or completed list. 

This application was build using NodeJS, JavaScript, Ionic Framework, Angular Framework, Typescript, HTML5, and uses a Firebase NoSQL database, and IGDB API for pulling gaming data.  

Currently, this project is not working properly due to IGDB updating their API since the time of development.
